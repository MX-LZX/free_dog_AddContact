## Note！！
1. At present, GZP6859A040KPP50K has been discontinued,
   if you are in China, you can choose to buy XGZP6859A040KPP50K
   or any 40kpa pressure sensor that can directly output analog quantity.
2. The unitree go1 series foot end interface is a metal tube with an outer diameter of 1.5mm,
   while the gzp or xgzp series interface is an outer diameter of 2.5mm.
3. You can purchase a plastic tube with an inner diameter of 1.3mm + a pagoda adapter
   with an inner diameter of 1.6mm to 2.4mm + a plastic tube with an inner diameter of 2.5mm
   to complete the connection.
## A more universal solution
You can see the Old_Project folder, 
which contains the HX710 and INA333A external adc sampling schemes, 
compared to the gzp scheme, the sensor using MPS3117 may be easier to buy, 
but the communication rate between the HX710 and INA333A is relatively low.
